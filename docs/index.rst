====================================

steam.py is a modern, easy to use, and async ready API wrapper

Key Features
------------

- Modern Pythonic API using ``async``/``await`` syntax
- Command extension to aid with bot creation
- Easy to use with an object oriented design
- Fully typed hinted for faster development
