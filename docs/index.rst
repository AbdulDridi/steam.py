Welcome to steam.py's documentation!
====================================

steam.py is a modern, easy to use (I hope), and async ready API wrapper
for Steam. Heavily inspired by `discord.py <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py>`_

**Features:**

- Modern Pythonic API using ``async``/``await`` syntax
- Command extension to aid with bot creation (under development)
- Easy to use with an object oriented design
