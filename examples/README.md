# Examples

These are a specially curated collection of programs written with steam.py. More information about any of the functions
used can be found in [the documentation](https://steampy.rtfd.io/en/latest).

More examples should be coming soon.

- For a basic bot using ext.commands, see [`basic_bot.py`](basic_bot.py).
- For a client that automatically replies to messages, see [`reply.py`](reply.py).
- For a basic trade framework that prints trades to stdout and auto-accepts gifts see [`trade.py`](trade.py).
- For an automatic suspicious comment deleter see [`comment_monitor.py`](comment_monitor.py)

###### Anyways that's all from me for now, Good luck and happy coding.
