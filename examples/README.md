# Examples

These are a specially curated collection of programs written with steam.py. It should be easy what they are doing 
if you read their comments and have a good grasp of Python. More information any of the functions used in them 
can be found in [the documentation](https://steampy.rtfd.io/en/latest).

More examples should be coming soon.

<!-- - For a basic bot using ext.commands, see [basic.py](basic_bot.py). (spooky, this one isn't done yet) -->
- For a basic trade framework that prints trades to stdout and auto-accepts gifts see [`trade.py`](trade.py). 

These examples shouldn't really be copied but are more of a demonstration of what the library can do, 
it also encourages people to copy and paste code that they don't understand. 

Realistically if you don't understand what is going on in these examples you aren't ready to use this library.
This is due to the to the semi-complex nature of the library along with asynchronous programming, 
it can be rather overwhelming for a beginner. Properly learning python will both prevent confusion and frustration 
when receiving help from others but will make it easier when reading documentation and when debugging any 
issues in your code.
