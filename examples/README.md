# Examples

These are a specially curated collection of programs written with steam.py. It should be easy what they are doing 
if you read their comments and have a good grasp of Python. More information any of the functions used in them 
can be found in [the documentation](https://steampy.rtfd.io/en/latest).

More examples should be coming soon.

<!-- - For a basic bot using ext.commands, see [basic.py](basic_bot.py). (spooky, this one isn't done yet) -->
- For a basic trade framework that prints trades to stdout and auto-accepts gifts see [`trade.py`](trade.py). 
- For an automatic suspicious comment deleter see [`comment_monitor.py`](comment_monitor.py)

###### Anyways that's all from me for now, Good luck and happy coding.
